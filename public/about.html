<h1>Nkululeko Dlamini: From Lab Coats to Code</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Nkululeko Dlamini, from South Africa. I'm based in Pinetown and working as a Quality Laboratory Supervisor.</p>

<p>While I enjoy the precision and detail-oriented nature of my lab work, I've recently discovered a fascination with web development. The idea of creating something from scratch, something that can inform and connect people, is incredibly exciting.</p>

<p>This is my little corner of the web, a space for me to explore this new passion for coding. I'm eager to learn everything I can and see if I can one day transition into the dynamic world of web development.
</p>
<p>Feel free to follow along on my coding journey!</p>
